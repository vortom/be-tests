## Implement Missing API Methods Based on OpenAPI Specification 

```
The 'petstore_swagger.json' file contains the OpenAPI specification, and 'pet.py' file includes a wrapper to call this API from Python tests. Please review the OpenAPI specification and implement Python methods for any endpoints that have not been implemented yet. Thank you.
```

## Implement New API Methods Based on OpenAPI Specification 

```
The 'petstore_swagger.json' file contains the OpenAPI specification. The 'pet.py' file contains an example implementation of methods used to call endpoints from tests. Please review both files and implement methods for the 'Store' endpoints according to the OpenAPI specification, following the same implementation style. Save the new implementation in the 'store.py' file. Thank you!
