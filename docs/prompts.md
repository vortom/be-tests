## Implement Missing API Methods Based on OpenAPI Specification 

```
The 'petstore_swagger.json' file contains the OpenAPI specification, and 'pet.py' file includes a wrapper to call this API from Python tests. Please review the OpenAPI specification and implement Python methods for any endpoints that have not been implemented yet. Thank you.
